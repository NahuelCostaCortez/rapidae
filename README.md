# Rapidae: Python Library for Rapid Creation and Experimentation of Autoencoders

## Description

Rapidae is a Python library specialized in simplifying the creation and experimentation of new autoencoder models. With a focus on ease of use, Rapidae allows users to explore and develop autoencoder models in an efficient and straightforward manner.

## Main features

- Ease of Use: Rapidae has been designed to make the process of creating and experimenting with autoencoders as simple as possible, users can create and train autoencoder models with just a few lines of code.

- Backend versatility: RapidAE was develovep using the new version Keras 3.0. This adds the ability to run experiments on three different backends (Tensorflow, Pytorch and Jax) allows users to take advantage of the specific strengths of each without having to learn new syntaxes. Rapidae handles the abstraction, allowing researchers to focus on the design and evaluation of their models.
